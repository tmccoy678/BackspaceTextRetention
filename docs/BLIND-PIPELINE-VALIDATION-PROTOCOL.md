# Blinded byte-recovery validation protocol

**Declared before generation and decoding on 2026-09-24.**

## Purpose

This validation estimates whether the repository's read-only byte-inspection
pipeline can recover previously unseen synthetic draft strings from the same
byte structure observed in the discovery transcript. It tests fixture parsing
and exact transcription. It does not estimate the probability that every
interpretation of the historical experiment is correct, and it does not test a
cloud model's access to unsubmitted typing.

## Blinding and fixation

1. Generate ten targets with Python's `secrets` module without printing them.
2. Make each target 15 ASCII characters long, with mixed-case letters, digits,
   spaces, and the punctuation characters `.`, `-`, and `_` available to the
   generator. The first and last characters are alphanumeric.
3. Store each target in a transcript-like fixture as:

   ```text
   non-printing boundary + target + 15 * (08 20 08) + committed string + boundary
   ```

4. Save the hidden target table and its SHA-256 commitment before decoding.
5. Commit the protocol, generator, targets, fixtures, and commitment to Git
   before inspecting fixture contents.
6. Run the existing read-only inspection tool on each fixture. Freeze the ten
   reported `BEFORE` values and erase counts in a separate recovery file.
7. Only after that recovery file is fixed, compare it with the hidden target
   table and verify the target-table commitment.

The blinding is procedural rather than cryptographic: the target file exists on
the same machine and could technically be opened, but it must not be read or
displayed before the recoveries are frozen.

## Endpoints

Primary endpoints, scored per fixture:

- exact target recovery, including case, spaces, punctuation, and length;
- exact recovery of fifteen `08 20 08` erase triplets.

Report the number correct out of ten and every mismatch. A result of 10/10 is
an observed error count of 0/10, not proof that the pipeline's general error
rate is zero. No *t* test applies because the outcomes are paired exact-match
indicators, not continuous means.
