The formula metadata captured on the experiment machine is preserved at

## macOS terminal tools

The local `script(1)` manual distinguishes ordinary terminal recording from its
separate key-recording option. The experiment invoked `/usr/bin/script -q` and
did **not** invoke `-k`. On macOS, inspect the installed manual with:

```sh
man 1 script
man 1 stty
man 4 termios
```

The exact experimental terminal-mode command is preserved in
[`tools/original-raw-tty-wrapper.zsh`](../tools/original-raw-tty-wrapper.zsh).

## Local model

The model was Mistral AI's `Ministral-3-14B-Instruct-2512-Q5_K_M.gguf`.
Its name, size, SHA-256, license, and observed runtime are recorded in
[`provenance/MODEL-MANIFEST.md`](../provenance/MODEL-MANIFEST.md). The 9.6 GB
weight file is not included.
